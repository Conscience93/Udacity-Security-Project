Executive Summary

Our linux servers had been compromised by the attackers and they managed to brute force on one of our user. They elevated the user privilege and
use it to create new user for themselves and create a malicious process for remote execution for further attacks. All the new user and process had been contained.
From this incident, we detected several vulnerabilities in our servers and we have recommended several recommendations to be done immediately, most notably strong
password policies and securing remote login processes.
