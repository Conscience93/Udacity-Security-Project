Executive Summary

Our linux servers had been compromised by the attackers and they managed to brute force on one of our user account. Through this, they elevated the user privilege to
root access and use it to create a new user for themselves and to create a malicious process for remote execution to further their attacks. Through logging, we are
able to find the new user and process and they had all been contained. From this incident, we detected several vulnerabilities in our servers and we have recommended
several recommendations to be done immediately, most notably a strong password policy to prevent brute force attacks and securing remote login processes by allowing
only certain ip addresses as well as setting up multi-factor authentication.
